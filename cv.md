## Education
* I am a graduate student at **Georgia Tech** now. After doing research for 2 years, I am very passionate about
high performance software system, so I decide switch my focus to **Software System** and **Architecture** 
for my graduate study. 

* I received *Bachelor of Science* degree in **Computer Science** from **Georgia Tech**. In my undergraduate
study, I took many **Artificial Intelligence** related courses, such as **Machine Learning** and **Natural Language
Processing**. 

* I started my undergraduate study at __Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology__. At **Rose-Hulman**, I took my
first programming class in **Python** and then I made my mind to study **Computer Science**. I transferred to 
**Georgia Tech** in my second year.

## Experience
* I am a **Research Assistant**, under supervision of [Dr. Hyesoon Kim](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hyesoon/). I
mostly work with my mentor [Ramyad Hadidi](https://ramyadhadidi.github.io). Our focus is to build **robust** and 
**high performance** system. 

* I was a **Software Engineer Intern** on infrastructure team of *Clinc Inc*. My main project was deploying the 
product onto a distributed environment backed by **Kubernetes** cluster. Meanwhile, I also paralleled workflow
in product pipeline to reduce latency.
