## Research Interests
Computer Systems, Architecture, Machine Learning.

## Education
* I am a graduate student at **Georgia Tech** now. After doing research for 2 years, I am interested in
general Computer Systems problems, so I decide switch my focus to Computer Systems and Architecture
for my graduate study. 

* I received Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from **Georgia Tech**. In my undergraduate
study, I took many Artificial Intelligence related courses, such as Machine Learning and Natural Language
Processing. 

* I started my undergraduate study at **Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology**. At **Rose-Hulman**, I took my
first programming class in Python and then I made my mind to study Computer Science. I transferred to 
**Georgia Tech** in my second year.

## Research Positions
* *EVA Hardware*, I worked on accelerating visual data analytics on both edge devices and cloud.
    * Specialized lightweight deep neural networks.
    * Compression scheme tailored for edge devices.
    * Workload scheduling.
* *Parallel ML*, I worked on distributing machine learning computation on multiple devices, analyzing machine 
learning workloads on multiple platforms. 
    * Edge centric machine learning workloads distribution.
    * Machine learning workloads profiling and analysis.
    * Parallel platforms tailored deep neural networks design.

## Experience
* I TA'ed CS-3220 Processor Design class at **Georgia Tech**.

* I was a Software Engineer Intern on infrastructure team of **Clinc Inc**. My main project was deploying the 
product onto a distributed environment backed by Kubernetes cluster. Meanwhile, I also paralleled workflow
in product pipeline to reduce latency.
